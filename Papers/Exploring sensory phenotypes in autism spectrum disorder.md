## Objectives

>investigate patterns in [[Sensory processing]] abilities in a large sample of [[Autistic]] children and adults in order to determine the best number of [[Sensory phenotypes]] to describe their [[Sensory processing]] abilities. 

>identify  relations between [[Sensory processing]] differences and adaptive functioning, [[Autistic]] traits, and traits related to commonly co-occurring [[Neurodevelopmental disorders]] including [[ADHD]] and [[OCD]]

## Procedure
 
Data of 599 participants of Ontario’s Neurodevelopmental Disorder database :

>Participants were included if they had a diagnosis of [[ASD]], [[Autism]], [[Asperger’s]], or [[Pervasive Developmental Disorder Not Otherwise Specified (PDD-NOS)]] and a completed short sensory profile [[SSP]]

Their answers on various questionnaires were then computed to create clusters
## Results

>Given the pattern of the [[SSP]] sub-scale scores across the clusters in the five-cluster model, we classified cluster 1 as a [[Sensory adaptative (SA)]], cluster 2 as a [[Generalized Sensory Differences (GSD)]], cluster 3 as a [[Taste and Smell Sensitivity (TSS)]], cluster 4 as an [[Under-Responsive and Sensory Seeking (URSS)]], and cluster 5 as a [[Movement and Low Energy-Weakness (M-LEW)]]
## Conclusion

>the first two [[Sensory phenotypes]] to emerge from our data were a [[Sensory adaptative (SA)]] and a [[Generalized Sensory Differences (GSD)]].

Then were identified 3 [[Sensory phenotypes]] :
- [[Taste and Smell Sensitivity (TSS)]]
- [[Under-Responsive and Sensory Seeking (URSS)]]
- [[Movement and Low Energy-Weakness (M-LEW)]]

>the [[Under-Responsive and Sensory Seeking (URSS)]] and [[Movement and Low Energy-Weakness (M-LEW)]] [[Sensory phenotypes]] showed poor adaptive functioning, suggesting that [[Autistic]] individuals who demonstrate particularly high levels of under-responsivity and sensory seeking, movement difficulties, and low energy, may be those who will benefit most from [[Environments]] that support these sensory differences

>grouping [[Autistic]] individuals by these [[Sensory phenotypes]] could allow for more focused interventions that target the sensory domains, and behaviors, that present the most difficulty for those individuals
