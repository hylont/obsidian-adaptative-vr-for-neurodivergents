## Objectives

>explore if [[Virtual Reality]]  has the potential to be used specifically as a tool to evaluate the special [[Sensory processing pattern]] in children with [[ASD]]. 

>We hypothesized that: 1) compared to [[Adult-Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP)]], SAVR could detect more significant differences between the two participant groups, and 2) there are significant and strong correlations between the SAVR results and the [[Adult-Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP)]] results. 
## Experimental Design

>SAVR (...) consisted of a centralized game and device controller, a gaze module [[Eye-tracking]], a touch module, a display module, and a data logging module.

>The participants operated a stylus on the robot as if they were using a pen, and they received touch feedback from it. Eye gaze of the participant was recorded by an eye tracker,
>The game consisted of 12 episodes. In each episode, a maze-like structure occupied the majority of the game scene. Meanwhile, 3D objects that rotated at a random speed in ﬁxed positions were presented as potential distractions. The player (study participant) could move a painting ball in 3D using the haptic robot. When the ball was pushed against the frontal surface of the maze, the touched (by the painting ball) segments of the maze would turn yellow
## Participants

>The inclusion criteria were age from 11 to 17 years and existing [[ASD]] diagnoses for participants with [[ASD]].

>Twelve adolescents with [[ASD]] (11 males and 1 female; Age (years): avg = 14.25; SD = 2.18) and 12 [[Typically developed (TD)]] adolescents (6 males and 6 females; Age (years): avg = 14.5; SD = 2.18) aged 11-17 years participated in the experiments.
## Measures

- Gaze on Distractions and Gaze on Maze : >the percentage of total gaze points fell inside the distraction region and the maze region, respectively.
- Visual Fixation on Distractions and on Maze : maintaining of gaze on a single location indicating focus (0.7° recommended by P. Blignaut)
- Gaze Saccade Duration : Quick movements of eyes
- Gaze Saccade velocity : eye speed
- Gaze Spreading : Overall gaze distribution across the screen
- Painting Speed : Length of the maze divided by time taken for painting
- Lift distance and Press distance : from the pen to the surface of the maze

## Results

>there were no significant differences on GoD and GoM between the groups. Both participants with [[ASD]] and [[Typically developed (TD)]] participants looked less at the distractions in the 3D setting than in the 2D setting 

>These mean the group with [[ASD]] tended to keep the ball closer to the maze and lifted the ball off the maze less than the [[Typically developed (TD)]] group. This required careful control of the robot. 

>the participants with [[ASD]] pressed less hard on the maze in the 2D setting. This difference was gone in 3D.

>This behavior would make the participants felt less touch resistant and should be checked to see if it was related to touch sensation [[Avoidance]]. 

>The negative correlation between sensation seeking and FoD means participants with higher sensation [[Seeking]] behaviors tended to fi their gaze less on the distractions, indicating that the rotating objects were not what they seek to watch. The positive correlation between sensation [[Avoidance]] and SacD means participants with higher sensation [[Avoidance]] behaviors tended to have longer quick eye gaze shifting, possibly due to moving their gaze away from uncomfortable visual [[Stimuli]]. 
## Conclusion

>the more sensitive the participants were, the more they looked at the distractions. 

>Moreover, SAVR identifies more significant differences between the two groups than the [[Adult-Adolescent Sensory Profile (AASP)]], suggesting that a [[Virtual Reality]] based system may have better assessment sensitivity than a traditional questionnaire that relies upon adolescent or parent awareness of [[Sensory processing]].
