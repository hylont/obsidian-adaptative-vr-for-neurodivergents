# Background

>"the experience of self can be enhanced if other beings exist in the virtual world" (Biocca et al., 2003)

>[[Retro-olfaction]], evident from the moment a child is born (Candau, 2000), is a physiological mechanism that enables the olfactory system to perceive aromatic characteristics

>depriving ourselves of the powerful emotional tone of odors would mean "cutting ourselves off from an essential link with the world" (Holley, 1999)

>According to the work of André Holley, the olfactory channel may have two dimensions: a "cognitive dimension" driven by olfactory signals, and a "motivational dimension of sensory stimuli"
# Objectives

>to what extent this technology may reduce the attentional and sensorimotor disorders of an autistic public with specific psycho-sensory percepts ?
# Experimental Design & Procedure

>During the design process, the VE was adjusted after each trial according to the difficulties observed by the medical-educational team or the observations of the participants. These modifications included a reduction in light intensity (visual hypersensitivity), an increase in olfactory stimuli, and the addition of certain pictograms

>The equipment was also modified to facilitate observation of the VE, for example by replacing a fixed chair with a swivel chair

>A meta Quest 2 headset was used to immerse the participants in the virtual supermarket. 
>They had to collect different products from the shelves in a basket, according to their wishes, in order to enable selfdetermination.

>A guide-experimenter pressed a key on the keyboard to teleport the participants from point to point in the shop: bakery, fishmonger, fruit, flowers, bookshop.

>A garden, designed as a sensory resting place was proposed to give each user a cognitive break. An avatar, designed to resemble the physiognomy of the educational team co-ordinator, was also implemented to enable users to ask for help

>As users stroll through the virtual supermarket, they synchronously diffuse a fragrance corresponding to the food on the shelves, encouraging visual identification and olfactory stimulation: coffee, chocolate, apple, orange.
# Participants

>The cohort is made up of 8 young adults with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), language impairment and Intellectual Development Disorder

- 4 men - 4 women
- Average age: 23
- 6 out of 8 subjects have no access to writing or reading
- 8 out of 8 have impaired oral language skills

>Clinical assessments were based on the international diagnostic scale AMSE - Autism Mental Status Exam. Seven significant ASD items are rated from 0 to 2, depending on the severity of the impairments: eye contact, interest in others, pointing ability, language, language pragmatics, stereotypies, intrusive preoccupations. The average score for the group (1.6/2) indicates moderate to severe language impairment.
# Measures


# Results

>The results of the study confirm that VR techniques with an anthropocentric focus can promote activity engagement and learning in dyscommunicative autistic people
>The results also underline the importance of a VE designed in affordance with the psycho-sensory needs of learners to increase their cognitive availability and, subsequently, their learning.

>the choice of scents was closely linked to the interests and tastes of the autistic people

>On the other hand, an olfactory surplus could prove repellent to a subject with olfactory hypersensitivity or who rejects one of the scents inhaled. A detailed knowledge of the user's sensory specificities is therefore essential in this field of experimentation

>in the field of autism, "personalization according to centers of interest is a prerequisite for arousing interest"

>At the end of the first experiments, users' verbatims, facial expressions and gestures revealed sensations of pleasure when scent was diffused

>Olfactory feedback supports the correlation towards the subject's ability to memorize, evoking pleasure, and thus developing motives for activity
# Conclusion

>Results showed that VR with an anthropocentric focus can promote activity engagement and learning in dyscommunicative autistic people. The results also highlight the need to design and offer immersive environments specifically tailored to the psycho-sensory needs of the end users, in this case young adults with autism.
