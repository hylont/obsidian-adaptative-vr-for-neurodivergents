[[Internal action models (IAMs)]]
[[Typically developed (TD)]]
[[ASD]]
[[Pleasantness judgment]]

## Openings

>olfaction and odor are used to gage and influence the emotions of others and thus play a meaningful role in social communication

>the degree of alteration in sniff response was predictive of impaired social communication (Figure 3C), but not of generalized motor impairment
## Objectives

> we set out to test the hypothesis that the sniff response will be altered in children with [[ASD]]

## Experimental Design

>computer-controlled air-dilution olfactometer equipped with a custom-designed double-barreled pediatric nasal cannula that allowed us to simultaneously deliver odors and measure nasal airflow (Figure 1). We used this apparatus to precisely measure the sniff response following pleasant (rose or shampoo) and unpleasant (sour milk or rotten fish) odors .... The 10-min procedure consisted of 20 trials (10 of each valence), each 1–2 s in duration, separated by a 30-s intertrial interval. During the paradigm, participants watched a cartoon.

>using a six-point VAS where each point was also denoted by a ‘‘smiley,’’ ranging from a happy face associated with pleasant to a sad face associated with unpleasant. To assess general motor performance in [[ASD]], we conducted three tasks: an FTT, SOG, and MPT
## Participants

>18 children with [[ASD]] (17 boys, mean age = 7 ± 2.3) and 18 age- and gender-matched typically developing ([[Typically developed (TD)]]) children (17 boys, mean age = 6.7 ± 2.1) as controls (Table 1)

>only about one in four children approached at the Autism Center agreed to participate. This raises a selection bias concern whereby perhaps only a specific subset of [[ASD]] (those who agreed) was tested
## Measures

>To characterize the [[Typically developed (TD)]] and [[ASD]] sniff responses, we extracted four sniff parameters: sniff volume, peak airflow rate, mean airflow rate, and duration.

## Results

>We used a multivariate normal density classifier applied to the sniff parameters and found that a classifier relying on the differences in pleasant versus unpleasant sniff duration combined with the sniff volume for unpleasant odors effectively distinguished [[Typically developed (TD)]] from [[ASD]] children. Using a leave-one-out analysis, the classifier correctly identified 17 of 18 TD children as well as 12 of 18 ASD children, i.e., one false positive and six false negatives (81% accuracy, binomial p < 0.001) (Figure 3A). In contrast to a group difference alone, this power at the singlesubject level implies that an altered sniff response is a genuine part of [[ASD]]

>more aberrant sniffing (longer sniff durations for unpleasant versus pleasant odors) was associated with an increase in autism severity (r = 0.75, p < 0.0005) (Figure 3B). Notably, this correlation between the sniff-dependent measure and [[ADOS]] scores is very similar to the [[ADOS]] test retest correlation

>the sniff response remained highly predictive of the social affect component of [[ADOS]] (r = 0.72, p < 0.001) (Figure 3C), but it was unrelated to the restricted and repetitive behavior component of [[ADOS]]
## Conclusion

>[[Typically developed (TD)]] children exhibited an adult-like sniff response, but [[ASD]] children did not activate the olfactory IAM to adjust their sniff in accordance with odorant properties.

>Finally, several technical issues (such as compliance) need to be addressed before this could become a useful tool in clinics

>Thus, the results obtained here are supportive of the notion that impaired IAMs are at the mechanistic root of [[ASD]].
