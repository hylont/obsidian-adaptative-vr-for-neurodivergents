# Background

>Sensory processing questionnaires have also demonstrated abnormal responses to odors and tastes among children with [[ASD]] [4, 5], but also to cold, heat, pain, tickle, and itch [6, 7]

>Studies evaluating various [[Olfactory]] abilities in [[ASD]] have been limited and have mainly explored abilities of odor detection (at the threshold level) and identification

>the ratings of intensity, pleasantness, familiarity, and edibility are different olfactory judgments that require activation from perceptual to semantic representations [24, 25]

>Emotion and pleasantness judgment are primary facets of [[Olfaction (or smell)]] [29], and the pleasantness judgment is commonly used to rate subjective emotional experience

>Moreover, odor identification performances have been correlated with self-ratings of [[empathy]] [18], one of the most clearly impaired cognitive functions in individuals with [[ASD]]
# Objectives

>We hypothesized that individuals with [[ASD]] would make modified intensity and [[Pleasantness judgment]] , perceiving odors more intense and/or more unpleasant than control participants. They would display a greater number of errors compared to control participants in the [[Suprathreshold detection]] task because they would adopt a more liberal decision criterion than the control participants, and would have reduced identification performances
# Experimental Design & Procedure

>The entire experiment comprised four successive tests: [[Suprathreshold detection]], [[Intensity judgment]], [[Pleasantness judgment]]s , and identification

>The order of the tests was identical for all participants. In each test, the experimenter presented a jar containing an odorant under the participant’s nose in 30-s intervals, with each odorant presented for approximately 5 s

 - [[Suprathreshold detection]]
 >This test included 24 trials in which the participants were required to decide whether the stimuli were odorant or non-odorant (NO). They responded orally “yes” or “no,”

- [[Intensity judgment]] and [[Pleasantness judgment]]
>the intensity and pleasantness judgment tests were successively performed using two sets of the same 12 odorants: rose, caramel, tar, banana, onion, vanilla, camphor, guaiacol, anise, cyclohexane, tomato, and bitter almond. The participants judged to what extent they perceived the odors as intense (intensity test) or pleasant (pleasantness test) using a segmented linear rating scale ranging from 0 to 10.

- Identification
>The participants were asked to identify each odor by choosing a name among a written list of five alternatives that included the veridical label, one name evoking a similar odor, and three names evoking more distinct odors.
# Participants

>The [[ASD]] group included 15 adults with [[High-functioning autism (HFA)]] or [[Asperger syndrome]] ... received a diagnosis of autism or Asperger syndrome from a psychiatrist or a licensed clinical psychologist ... All participants in the [[ASD]] group were free of medication and did not suffer from any [[Mental disorder]] or [[Neurological disorder]] other than [[ASD]]

>Participants in the [[ASD]] group were matched by age and gender to a group of 15 typically developing individuals

# Measures

>If the stimulus was an odor and the participant declared to have perceived an odor, a “hit” was scored. If the participant did not perceive an odor, a “miss” was scored. If the stimulus was “no odor” and was declared so by the participant, a “correct rejection” was scored. If the participant incorrectly declared to have perceived an odor, a “false alarm” (FA) was scored.

>four parameters were then calculated for each participant: the hit rate (HR), FA rate (FR), discrimination measurement d’L, and bias response (CL).

# Results

>participants with [[ASD]] had lower suprathreshold detection scores and used a more liberal decision criterion than the control participants;
>participants with [[ASD]] judged odors to be more intense and perceived unpleasant odors to be less unpleasant than the control participants; and
>participants with [[ASD]] identified odors less well than the control participants

- [[Suprathreshold detection]]
>ANOVAs revealed that the FA scores were significantly higher in the [[ASD]] group than the control group
>[[ASD]] participants had difficulty discriminating between the presence and absence of an odor
>No significant difference in the Hit scores was identified

>when uncertain, the participants with [[ASD]] responded yes more often than no when no odor was present.

- Identification
>individuals with [[ASD]] were significantly less able to identify odorants

>Two studies have reported normal olfactory identification in children with [[ASD]] [9, 90], but the discrepancies between studies can be explained by the limited odor identification abilities of the youngest children

>An atypical ability to identify odors has been recently suggested to result from a reduced facility to use verbal labels and has been associated with [[Autism]] rather than [[Asperger syndrome]]

>observed a higher number of near and far misses in the individuals with [[ASD]] than in the control participants

- Intensity and pleasantness
>participants with [[ASD]] found both pleasant and unpleasant odors less intense than control participants

>Compared with the control participants, the individuals with [[ASD]] judged odors to be more intense

>previous reports of heightened sensory perceptions in individuals with [[ASD]], regardless of the sensory modality [2–4, 60]. Thus, [[Hyperresponsiveness (or hyperreactivity)]] to sensory stimuli must not be confused with hypersensitivity indicative of a decreased sensory detection threshold.

>On average, the participants with [[ASD]] judged pleasant odors in a manner similar to the control participants, but they evaluated unpleasant odors to be less unpleasant

# Conclusion

>[[Hyperresponsiveness (or hyperreactivity)]] to stimuli is not incompatible with a flattened emotional reaction.

>dysfunction of different levels of process that were not inevitably specifically [[Olfactory]], but that involve several brain regions exhibiting anatomical and functional abnormalities in [[ASD]]

>increased intensity judgment scores for all odors and reduced pleasantness judgment scores for unpleasant odors.

>We suggest that the lower identification performance in individuals with [[ASD]] is not due to or only to a perceptual or semantic deficit but could also be related to an attentional deficit.
