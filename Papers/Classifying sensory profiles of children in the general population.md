## Objectives

- Find which model of [[Sensory subtypes (or phenotypes)]] is more optimal.
- Determine whether or not children with a *"condition"* (= [[ASD]] or [[ADHD]]) have the same [[Sensory subtypes (or phenotypes)]] than *"[[Typically developed (TD)]] children"*

## Procedure

>This cross-sectional study used a sample (n= 1132) gathered from a larger study of the reliability and validity of the Sensory Profile 2nd Edition Child Form [[SSP]] (Dunn 2014). Participants were recruited across the USA, and data were collected online.

>For the current analysis, we included 1132 participants aged 3â€“14 years with parent-reported typical development (n=788), [[ASD]] (n= 77), [[ADHD]] (n= 96), [[ASD]]+[[ADHD]] (n= 24), [[Learning disability]] (n = 44), [[Intellectual disability]] (n = 9), [[Down syndrome]] (n= 9), [[developmental delay]] (n= 11) and other conditions (n= 58). The other conditions group included children with a history of low birthweight and prematurity. The sample included those identified as gifted and talented as well (n= 18)
## Results

>We investigated the results of three to six [[Sensory subtypes (or phenotypes)]], and we considered the four and five profile solutions ... Therefore, we identified the five profile solutions as most optimal 

>Children with and without conditions fell within each [[Sensory subtypes (or phenotypes)]], and the percentages of children within each condition category by subtype varied 

- 1 Balanced (*"overall low sensory processing scores"*) 
	- > Clearly, some children with ASD demonstrate adaptive, or expected, responses to sensory experiences. 
	- 88.6% of [[Typically developed (TD)]]
	- 35.1% of [[ASD]]
	- 53.1% of [[ADHD]]
- 2 Interested (*"high rates of sensory [[Seeking]] with low scores on other sensory patterns"*)
	- > Children in this group may be seeking out different sensory stimuli, such as movement, tactile or auditory, and enjoy intense sensory experiences. 
	- > Research suggests that children with typical development show similar rates of sensory seeking to children with conditions until the age of 4 years. However, sensory seeking in children with conditions such as ASD and ADHD increases as children age, whereas the sensory seeking in typically developing children decreases 
	- 6.1% of [[Typically developed (TD)]]
	- 8.9% of [[ASD]]
	- 13.5% of [[ADHD]]
- 3 Intense (*"high sensory scores"*)
	- 2% of [[Typically developed (TD)]]
	- 19.5% of [[ASD]]
	- 10.4% of [[ADHD]]
- 4 Mellow until (*"high frequency of [[Registration]] (i.e. misses more sensory cues) and [[Avoidance]]"*)
	- > Children in this profile may not notice sensory stimuli (low registration) as quickly as other children. However, when a stimulus becomes salient enough for the child to notice, the stimuli may quickly become aversive (avoiding).
	- 2.3% of [[Typically developed (TD)]]
	- 11.7% of [[ASD]]
	- 10.4% of [[ADHD]]
- 5 Vigilant (*"increased sensitivity and [[Avoidance]] to sensory stimuli with low [[Seeking]] and [[Registration]] scores."*)
	- 1% of [[Typically developed (TD)]]
	- 24.7% of [[ASD]]
	- 12.5% of [[ADHD]]
## Conclusion

> [[Sensory subtypes (or phenotypes)]], while previously investigated in ASD only, occur across the general population of children including those with and without various developmental conditions. 

>Most [[Sensory subtypes (or phenotypes)]] are similar to those identified in [[ASD]]-only studies.
