OT = Occupational Therapist

## Objectives

>an immersive VR game aimed specifically at [[Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]] treatment. 

>sound effects - to stimulate the auditory system; graphic quality and a detailed colorful scenario  to stimulate vision; realistic physics-based movements and activities requiring the user’s constant movement of the head to stimulate the vestibular and proprioceptive systems. 

>The main purpose of the system is to offer new resources for OTs in their sensory processing treatments. 
## Key Quotes

>[[Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]] (aka sensory integration dysfunction) refer to conditions that are generated when a person’s brain is not able to integrate or organize (part of) the flow of sensory impulses so as to provide the individual with good, accurate information about herself/himself or the world around her/him, and can affect one or more senses at the same time 
>... 16% (1 in 6) children aged from 7 to 11 years suffer from this condition in the US 
## Experimental Design

>In order to allow OTs to evaluate the system, our process involved presenting Imaginator to the OT, and then making the system available to them in their treatment environment for approximately 2 to 3 weeks, and ﬁnally interviewing them about their experience in using the system. To collect data about the OTs experience we used semi-structured interviews, which allowed us to collect deep insights of the OTs experience and attitude towards the system.
## Participants

>have a formal degree as an OT, have at least 4 years of practical experience, and have experience in the treatment of [[Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]] 

>patients that were diagnosed as having [[Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]], aged between 4-15 years ... presented other comorbidities such as: [[Learning disability]], [[Autism]], [[Asperger syndrome]], [[Language disorder]], difficult in [[Motor coordination]] and [[ADHD]] 

## Procedures

>The system has three activities that were proposed by occupational therapists. They were named Playing Ball, Forming Word and Summation. In general, in all three activities the patient interacts with the game by “fixing" his/her sight on a moving object 
## Measures

>initial evaluation with occupational therapists. 

>After the use period, we scheduled a time to collect the system and conduct a 2nd interview with the OTs. This interview aimed at collecting data regarding the therapists’ experience in using Imaginator in their treatments. The interview script was organized in 2 themes, containing 12 questions: the ﬁrst focused on their experience in using the system in their therapy treatment; whereas the 2nd focused on their own experience with the therapist’s interface.
## Results

>The simulator generates the sense of [[Presence]] ... the greater its intensity, the greater the chance of the user behaving within the environment similarly to how they would behave in their day-to-day physical environment 

>The system generated [[Stimuli]] in more than one sense: In general, therapists perceived that the vestibular, proprioceptive, visual, tactile and auditory senses were being stimulated. They reported that the impact on the auditory sense could be negative, while the impact on the other senses were positive.

>patients were motivated to use the system, even when it would cause them some discomfort, for instance to put on the Oculus Rift

>increase patients relaxation and improve their concentration. 

>some of the patients had some negative reaction to the use of the system (e.g. headache, nau- sea, dizziness, sweating, euphoria, agitation and exhaustion), which were of short duration and were often reactions also seen in other therapeutic equipment. ... they are also symptoms of [[Cybersickness]]

>being able to customize the system was a very important feature in order to allow them to adapt the system to each patients’ needs. 

>patients lost interest in using the system after exploring all the possibilities and features offered 

>difficulties in getting the system ready to use. 
## Conclusion

>All of the participants said they would consider using the system in their treatments, not only for [[Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]], but also for patients with other comorbidities. 

>it would be interesting if the patient could have a virtual body within the system ...
>adding to the scenarios animate agents (e.g. people, animals or characters). These agents could be interesting in working other aspects associated to [[Sensory processing disorder (SPD)]] or other disorders, such as social interaction. 
>it could be interesting to allow the therapist to control not only if the sound is on or off, but also its volume, or even what sound effect should be associated to a given event 

>that besides being able to stimulate five different senses, it was very motivating to patients, which is a factor of great importance in the treatment
