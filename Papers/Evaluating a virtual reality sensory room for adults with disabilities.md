## Objectives
>investigate the impact of a VR sensory room intervention on anxiety, depression, personal wellbeing, sensory processing and adaptive behaviour for adults with disability. 

>sensory processing issues are linked to poor physical and mental ­health. Sensory processing difficulties can result in limitations with self-care, participation in the co­mmunity, quality of ­life and adaptive ­functioning. Further, sensory processing difficulties and anxiety were observed to co-occur in children with ­ADHD and autistic ­children. Depression and sensory processing difficulties have also been linked in adults with affective ­disorders.
## Experimental Design

>single intervention pre-post mixed method ­design where quantitative data was collected at both pre and post-test via survey, while qualitative data was completed at post-test only via interview.
## Participants

>Participants included 31 adults with disabilities where 16 (50.0%) were diagnosed with intel- lectual disability (ID) but not autism, 8 (25.0%) were diagnosed with both ID and autism, and 4 (12.5%) were diagnosed with ASD but not ID 

>Par- ticipants used Evenness on average 6 times (range 2–8) over the 5 month study period. The average length of total usage during this period was 26 min and 7 s with a median time use of 13 min and 54 s 

## Procedures

>offering to provide calming or stimulating sensory input aiming to enhance sensory processing, wellbeing, and adaptive behaviour of people with disability through the VR program, Evenness

>Participants were able to determine their own usage and there was no set duration 

>Participants were able to access Evenness as part of their participation in the organisation’s day program at their request. Some participants attended the day program where the VR equipment was located and others who attended surrounding day programs were able to book Evenness use into their weekly activities. Participants were provided with transportation to access Evenness. Each participant using Evenness had their nominated participating carer with them throughout their use. The carer was a staff member of the organisation or their family member, was known and trusted by the participant and was trained and experienced in operating the VR equipment.
## Measures



## Results

>Previous studies of physical sensory rooms have reported reductions in anxiety in similar populations to the present ­study1. It is possible that the Evenness VR Sensory Room was able to successfully replicate a physical sensory room as intended, with the same observed reductions in anxiety 

>promising results were reported with depression ­severity and major ­depression for people without disability 

>Significant correlations observed in sensory sensitivity and low registration scores and VR usage indicated that increased time spent using the VR sensory room may have mediated the changes in sensory processing 
## Conclusion

>It could be hypothesised that a VR sensory room may impact anxiety, depression and sensory processing in the short term.
