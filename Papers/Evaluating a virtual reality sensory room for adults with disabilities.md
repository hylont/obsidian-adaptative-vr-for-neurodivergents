## Objectives

>investigate the impact of a VR sensory room intervention on [[Anxiety]], [[Depression]], personal [[Wellbeing]], [[Sensory processing]] and [[Adaptative behaviour]] for adults with [[Disability]]. 

>identify the reported benefits of Evenness for participants according to age, disability, usage or initial needs. 

## Key Quotes

>[[Sensory processing]] issues are linked to poor physical and mental ­health. [[Sensory processing]] difficulties can result in limitations with self-care, participation in the co­mmunity, quality of ­life and adaptive ­functioning. Further, [[Sensory processing]] difficulties and [[Anxiety]] were observed to co-occur in children with ­[[ADHD]] and [[Autistic]] ­children. [[Depression]] and [[Sensory processing]] difficulties have also been linked in adults with [[affective ­disorders]].
## Experimental Design

>single intervention pre-post mixed method ­design where quantitative data was collected at both pre and post-test via survey, while qualitative data was completed at post-test only via interview.
## Participants

>Participants included 31 adults with disabilities where 16 (50.0%) were diagnosed with [[Intellectual disability]] but not [[Autism]], 8 (25.0%) were diagnosed with both ID and autism, and 4 (12.5%) were diagnosed with [[ASD]] but not ID 

>Participants used Evenness on average 6 times (range 2–8) over the 5 month study period. The average length of total usage during this period was 26 min and 7 s with a median time use of 13 min and 54 s 

## Procedures

>Participants were able to access Evenness as part of their participation in the organisation’s day program at their request. Some participants attended the day program where the [[VR]] equipment was located and others who attended surrounding day programs were able to book Evenness use into their weekly activities. Participants were provided with transportation to access Evenness. Each participant using Evenness had their nominated participating carer with them throughout their use. The carer was a staff member of the organisation or their family member, was known and trusted by the participant and was trained and experienced in operating the [[VR]] equipment.

>Participants were able to determine their own usage and there was no set duration 

## Measures

Significant improvement in [[Anxiety]] 
>No significant correlation was observed between the duration of time spent in the VR Sensory  room and the mean difference in the reported anxiety between post- and pre-tests 

## Results

>Previous studies of physical [[Sensory room]]s have reported reductions in anxiety in similar populations to the present ­study. It is possible that the Evenness VR Sensory Room was able to successfully replicate a physical [[Sensory room]] as intended, with the same observed reductions in [[Anxiety]] 

>promising results were reported with [[Depression]] ­severity and major ­depression for people without [[Disability]] 

>Significant correlations observed in sensory sensitivity and low [[Registration]] scores and [[VR]] usage indicated that increased time spent using the [[VR]] [[sensory room]] may have mediated the changes in [[Sensory processing]] 

>improvements in anxiety and depression from pre to post, with changes in sensory processing, but no significant changes in adaptive behaviour or personal wellbeing. 
## Conclusion

>It could be hypothesised that a [[VR]] [[sensory room]] may impact [[anxiety]], [[depression]] and [[Sensory processing]] in the short term.
