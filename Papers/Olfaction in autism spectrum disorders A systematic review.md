## Correlations with other disorders/syndromes

[[High-functioning autism (HFA)]]
[[Low-functioning autism (LFA)]]
>Finally, the severity of [[ASD]] symptoms could be related to smell impairment. Indeed, Ashwin et al. (2014) found a clear correlation between autism severity and olfactory hyper-sensitivity in an olfactory threshold task, while patients with HFA appear to have a more marked impairment than delayed subjects with a similar IQ with respect to children with low-functioning autism

[[Fragile X syndrome]]
>The presence of specific genetic conditions could also affect the sense of smell in autism. For example, in patients with fragile X syndrome, the prevalence of olfactory impairment is higher, and also related to the severity of the condition

[[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]]
[[Huntington's chorea]]
[[Alzheimer's disease (AD)]]
[[Parkinson's disorder (PD)]]
>some research has focused on olfactory evaluation as a biomarker of neurodegeneration. Indeed, a clear correlation between loss of olfactory function (or decreased olfactory abilities in some cases) and neurodegenerative conditions, including Alzheimer’s (AD) and Parkinson’s disorder (PD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Huntington’s chorea (HC) and multiple system atrophy have been reported

[[Schizophrenia]]
>Other psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia, have been also associated with an olfactory dysfunction in some cases

## Facts about ASD's relation with olfaction

>Olfactory impairment has been reported in child and adolescent psychiatric conditions such as autism spectrum disorders

>Sensory impairment—especially concerning olfaction and taste subdomains—was reported in children with [[ASD]]s, both high and low functioning, with respect to other neurodevelopmental disorders such as developmental delay

>Studies on olfactory testing in [[ASD]]s have generally demonstrated a decrease in the ability to identify odors in people with [[ASD]]s when compared to healthy controls...This evidence confirms a deficit in the higher-level processing of sensory stimuli in [[ASD]]s

>When exposed to pleasant smells (like orange; Hrdlicka et al., 2011), people with [[ASD]]s seem to better perform at sorting tasks (Wilder et al., 2008); interestingly, there is a correlation, at least with extreme values, between a better identification of more pleasant odors and a worse performance on more unpleasant ones
## Physiological reactions

>people with [[ASD]]s were found to be more physiologically sensory reactive in terms of heart rate (HR) compared to neurotypicals across all sensitivity stimuli presented

>Interestingly, some odors stimulating the trigeminal nerve such as mint and chlorine have been reported to be differently perceived in children with [[ASD]] compared to typically developing children and have been associated to differences in heart rate and skin conductance responses

## Precautions about experiments and participants

>One of the main modulators of olfactory function in [[ASD]]s is age. Indeed, the ability to detect odors (olfactory sensitivity tasks) develops earlier in life, while odor identification capabilities are acquired later in adolescence (Dudova et al., 2011), and in a more heterogeneous way in children with [[ASD]]s than in neurotypicals. 
>The presence of specific genetic conditions could also affect the sense of smell in autism. For example, in patients with fragile X syndrome, the prevalence of olfactory impairment is higher, and also related to the severity of the condition
## How to measure olfactory assessment

>Olfactory function is usually assessed by administering a specific sensory questionnaire to parents (McIntosh, Miller, & Shyu, 1999) or by using modern psychophysical olfactory tests

>Olfactory detection is usually measured by the odor threshold test, which evaluates the lowest concentration of a stimulus (normally n-butanol, having a greater trigeminal component, or phenyl-ethyl-alcohol, with higher prevalence of pure olfactory components) that can be discerned

>The most well-known identification tests include the 40-odorant University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT; Doty, Shaman, & Dann, 1984) and the Sniffin’ Sticks Identification Test (Kobal et al., 1996), even though several other tools are available, such as the 3-item Quick Smell Identification Test (Q-SIT; Jackman & Doty, 2005), the 12-item Brief Smell Identification Test (B-SIT; Doty, Marcus, & Lee, 1996), the Smell Diskettes Olfaction Test (Simmen, Briner, & Hess, 1999), and the T&T Olfactometer (Toyota et al., 1978).

>Other common methods of odor assessment include discrimination and memory tests. To evaluate odor memory, the patient is required to smell an inspection odorant and to select the same odorant from a set of alternative odorants (Tourbier & Doty, 2007).
## Openings for research & interactions

>Furthermore, especially in childhood and low-functioning conditions, individuals with [[ASD]]s are often unable to explain their distress, meaning that parents and caregivers cannot organize the sensory environment around their needs in order to minimize the chances of that distress occurring.
>Specific psychoeducational strategies such as storytelling, comic strip conversations, themes of normalizing, and describing responses can be used and developed to help people with [[ASD]]s share and process their sensory experiences
