## Objectives

Study the impact of auditory and visual distractions on speed & accuracy of [[Neurodiverse]] and [[Neurotypical]] users. Distractions were task-relevant & task-irrelevant stimuli

## Experimental Design

Each participant saw a total of 30 visual search trials. The first three trials were practice trials to familiarize participants with [[Virtual Reality]] and the task. The remaining 27 trials were blocked combinations of trials that varied the number of distractors, the lighting condition, and the background sound. There were three levels of each variable leading to a 3 × 3 × 3 within-subjects design. Number of distractors had three levels: 5, 15, and 35; lighting condition had three levels: low, optimal, and high brightness; and background sound was an industrial machine noise and had three levels: none, low volume, high volume.

## Participants

52 volunteer, 20 participants identified as male, 28 identified as female, two identified as genderfluid, one as nonbinary, and one declined to respond. Racially, 38 identified as White, two identified as Hispanic/Latino,

two as African American, four as Asian American, three as Mixed Race, and three declined to respond. In terms of [[Neurodiverse]] status based on self-reporting, nine reported [[ADHD]], six reported [[Autism]], four reported a [[Learning disability]] (LD) and [[ADHD]], two reported LD and autism, six reported ADHD and autism, and 25 identified as [[Neurotypical]]. Ages ranged from 13 to 47 years with an average of 24.9

## Procedures

After a 5 minute demographic form, the participants were evaluated at 30 trials to recognize 5 aliens among distractors which only differed by a small feature. There were 84 possible target locations on a grid.

## Measures

- Response time form the stimulus to successful hit.
- Number of non-hits, or a hit on a non-target or a target that has already been tagged.

## Results

The data show that trials with more distractors tended to take longer to complete and were less accurate.

When a trial’s lighting condition was high or low, participants tended to be slower and less accurate than when the lighting condition was optimal. Surprisingly, however, the background sound distractors did not seem to have a main effect at either the low- or high-volume levels.

The increase in the number of distractors has a significantly greater negative impact on [[Neurodivergent]] participants, as they tended to be both slower and less accurate as the number of distractors increased.

[[Neurodivergent]] learners perform better, in terms of both speed and accuracy, on the [[Visual search]] task in the loud background sound condition than they do in the no-background sound condition, whereas [[Neurotypical]] participants show the opposite. It is important to note, however, that the loud background sound condition merely levels the playing field between [[Neurotypical]] and [[Neurodivergent]] participants and does not actually improve the performance of [[Neurodivergent]] participants beyond their [[Neurotypical]] peers.
## Conclusion

The fact that background sound led to an improvement on [[Neurodivergent]] participants performance carries important implications for testing the impact of design elements on performance.
