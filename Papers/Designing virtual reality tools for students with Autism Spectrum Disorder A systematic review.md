## Objectives

>the key aim of this study is to conduct a systematic and thematic review on the application of [[Virtual Reality]] in teaching and learning environments of [[Autistic]] students during the period 1996–2021. 

1. What type of [[Virtual Reality]] has been used most frequently in research with [[Autistic]]
students?
2. What are the research objectives that have been most often worked on for imple-
menting [[Virtual Reality]] for [[Autistic]] students?
3. What type of instrument has been the most employed by researchers in their
interventions for [[Autistic]] students?
4. What are the characteristics of the activities designed for the intervention of
[[Autistic]] students using [[Virtual Reality]] ?
5. What have been the most frequent results achieved in the implementation of [[Virtual Reality]]
for [[Autistic]] students?

## Protocol recommendations

>As such, Bozgeyikli et al. (2018) outline some of the features that enhance the use of [[Virtual Reality]] for [[Autistic]] people, including: predict- ability, customizable task complexity; control; realism; immersion; automation of feedback, assessment, reinforcement. 

## Redaction recommandations

>The results indicated an absence of control groups in comparing the findings in addition to a lack of details related to ethi- cal and safety practices. 

## Results

>In addition to this, the identification, interpretation, and emotional response was another of the objectives in 13.15% 

>42.10% (n = 16) of the studies used question- naires. ... [[Social Responsive Scale (SRS) ]] ... [[Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) ]] ... [[Communicative Responses/Acts Score Sheet (CRASS)]]

>Another of the results to highlight is that in 15.78% (n = 6) of the studies it is observed that [[Virtual Reality]] is very well accepted by [[Autistic]] students.

>the vast majority of questionnaires are used for diagnosis and not for the evaluation of improvements 

>children with [[Autism]] find it easier to interpret synthetic and computer-generated devices than natural [[Stimuli]]. 

>the learning of [[Autistic]] students will be favored when the user has interaction devices that are as [[Realistic]] as possible 

>For these authors [[Immersion]] is based on the technical capabilities of the [[Virtual Reality]] technology to produce sensory [[Stimuli]], while [[Presence]] is context dependent and is based on the individual’s subjective psychological response to [[Virtual Reality]]. Whereas [[Fidelity]] is that which allows the user to feel included in the environment in such a way that he/she considers every action to be as if he/she is performing it for real. 

>in 50% of the investigations there was no acceptance of [[Virtual Reality]], with side effects such as dizziness, anxiety, or [[Cybersickness]] identified. 
## Conclusion

>The most widely used type of virtual reality to date is desktop [[Virtual Reality]]. 

>the two most frequent research purposes have been: firstly, to develop and teach social skills and secondly, to work on the identifica- tion, interpretation, and emotional response of [[Autistic]] students 

>it is recommended to use an [[Avatar]] to ask the child what his or her mood is. The child could respond with a series of YES or NO cubes if he/she knows the expression that the avatar is express- ing. The cubes are used so that this activity can be navigated by [[Autistic]] students with different levels and input of communication.
