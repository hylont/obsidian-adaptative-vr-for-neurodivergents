## Objectives

>the key aim of this study is to conduct a systematic and thematic review on the application of VR in teaching and learning environments of autistic students during the period 1996–2021. 

1. What type of virtual reality has been used most frequently in research with autistic
students?
2. What are the research objectives that have been most often worked on for imple-
menting virtual reality for autistic students?
3. What type of instrument has been the most employed by researchers in their
interventions for autistic students?
4. What are the characteristics of the activities designed for the intervention of
autistic students using VR?
5. What have been the most frequent results achieved in the implementation of VR
for autistic students?

## Protocol recommendations

>As such, Bozgeyikli et al. (2018) outline some of the features that enhance the use of VR for autistic people, including: predict- ability, customizable task complexity; control; realism; immersion; automation of feedback, assessment, reinforcement. 

## Redaction recommandations

>The results indicated an absence of control groups in comparing the findings in addition to a lack of details related to ethi- cal and safety practices. 

## Results

>In addition to this, the identification, interpretation, and emotional response was another of the objectives in 13.15% 

>42.10% (n = 16) of the studies used question- naires. ... [[Social Responsive Scale (SRS) ]] ... [[Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ) ]] ... [[Communicative Responses/Acts Score Sheet (CRASS)]]

>Another of the results to highlight is that in 15.78% (n = 6) of the studies it is observed that VR is very well accepted by autistic students.

>the vast majority of questionnaires are used for diagnosis and not for the evaluation of improvements 

>children with autism find it easier to interpret synthetic and computer-generated devices than natural stimuli. 

>the learning of autistic students will be favored when the user has interaction devices that are as realistic as possible 

>For these authors immersion is based on the technical capabilities of the VR technology to produce sensory stimuli, while presence is context dependent and is based on the individual’s subjective psychological response to VR. Whereas fidelity is that which allows the user to feel included in the environment in such a way that he/she considers every action to be as if he/she is performing it for real. 

>in 50% of the inves- tigations there was no acceptance of VR, with side effects such as dizziness, anxi- ety, or cybersickness identified. 
## Conclusion

>The most widely used type of virtual reality to date is desktop virtual reality. 

>the two most frequent research purposes have been: firstly, to develop and teach social skills and secondly, to work on the identifica- tion, interpretation, and emotional response of autistic students 

>it is recommended to use an avatar to ask the child what his or her mood is. The child could respond with a series of YES or NO cubes if he/she knows the expression that the avatar is express- ing. The cubes are used so that this activity can be navigated by autistic students with different levels and input of communication.
