## Defining [[Neurodivergent]]s

- ### [[ASD]]
	- [[DSM-5]]
	- [[Low-functioning autism (LFA)]]
	- [[High-functioning autism (HFA)]]

- ### [[ADHD]]

- ### [[Mental disorder]] 
	- [[Down syndrome]]

- ### Other disabilities and disorders
	- [[Learning disability]]

## [[Neurodivergent]]s and perception
neurodivergents ONLY with sensory perception disorders > reference a paper

### [[Sensory profiles]]

### [[Neurodivergent]]s and [[Olfaction (or smell)]]


### [[Neurodivergent]]s and [[Hearing]]

- Mesophonia
- Phonophobia

### [[Neurodivergent]]s and [[Sight]]

## Defining [[VR]]

### [[Immersion]]

### [[Presence]]

### [[Incomfort in VR]]

### Avoiding confusion with other types of immersion

## [[Neurodivergent]]s reactions and [[Incomfort in VR]]


--- 
How can we design and validate a VR framework/document that allows VR creators to design experiences for neurodivergents without breaking their comfort, especially visual, olfactory and audio comfort ?
## Hypothesis

Following Dunn's [[Sensory profiles]], it's possible to adapt an experience's visual, olfactive and auditive stimuli after a first calibration experience

# Experimental design

Main challenges :
- Avoid [[Sensory fatigue]] and [[Desensitization]]
- We need to create a "Sensory sensibilities" file first, then load it on a second experiment. (And not [[Sensory profiles]], due to [[Classifying sensory profiles of children in the general population]])
- Be sure that the profile is still relevant some time after the calibration
- The olfactive stimuli need to be triggered by a mandatory interaction, to avoid double [[Scent]] contamination

Sound categories ? annoying, arousing, bad tendency memory, positive ?
Odors categories ?

Calibration :
DVs : 
- 

IVs :
- Environment :
	- Woods
	- Kitchen
	- Break room
- Audio stimuli (positive/arousing, neutral, randomly occurring noise/distracting)
	- For the woods
		- Bird chirp
		- 
		- Airplanes passing by loudly
	- For the kitchen
		- sizzling butter
		- microwave & microwave beep
		- Fridge noise
	- For the break room
		- 
		- Coffee machine
		- Noisy discussions
- Olfactive stimuli (static object distance triggered, grabbable/pushable triggered)
	- For the woods
		- 
		- Mushroom
	- For the kitchen
		- Butter (frying egg)
		- Hot bread
	- For the break room
		- Coffee
		- Orange
