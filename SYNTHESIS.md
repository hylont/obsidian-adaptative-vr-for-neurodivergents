## [[Neurodivergent]]s and perception

### [[Sensory profiles]]

### [[Neurodivergent]]s and [[Olfaction (or smell)]]

### [[Neurodivergent]]s and [[Hearing]]

## Defining [[VR]]

### [[Immersion]]

### [[Presence]]

### [[Incomfort in VR]]

### Avoiding confusion with other types of immersion

## [[Neurodivergent]]s reactions and [[Incomfort in VR]]


--- 
How can we design and validate a VR framework/document that allows VR creators to design experiences for neurodivergents without breaking their comfort, especially visual, olfactory and audio comfort ?
## Hypothesis

# Experimental design
