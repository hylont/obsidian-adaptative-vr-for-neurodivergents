>In order to understand how the co-occurrence of sensory processing patterns impacts behavior, research has begun to characterize groups of children based on differences of co-occurring sensory patterns [[Classifying sensory profiles of children in the general population]]

Different models emerged :

Lane et al (2014)
	1 [[Sensory adaptative (SA)]]
	2 [[Taste and Smell Sensitivity (TSS)]]
	3 [[Postural inattentive]]
	4 [[Generalized Sensory Differences (GSD)]]
Created using the Sensory **Experiences Questionnaire 3.0** only for children with ASD ([[Classifying sensory profiles of children in the general population]])

Ausderau et al (2014)
	1 Mild
	2 Sensitive-distressed
	3 Attenuated-preoccupied
	4 Extreme-mixed
Relevant for children with ASD ([[Classifying sensory profiles of children in the general population]])

However, Scheerer and Little came to the conclusion that 5 subtypes models were the most optimal :

[[Classifying sensory profiles of children in the general population]] :
	1 Balanced (*"overall low sensory processing scores"*)
	2 Interested (*"high rates of sensory [[Seeking]] with low scores on other sensory patterns"*)
	3 Intense (*"high sensory scores"*)
	4 Mellow until (*"high frequency of [[Registration]] (i.e. misses more sensory cues) and [[Avoidance]]"*)
	5 Vigilant (*"increased sensitivity and [[Avoidance]] to sensory stimuli with low [[Seeking]] and [[Registration]] scores."*)
This model characterizes children from 3 to 14 with and without conditions

[[Exploring sensory phenotypes in autism spectrum disorder]] :
	1 [[Sensory adaptative (SA)]]
	2 [[Taste and Smell Sensitivity (TSS)]]
	3 [[Under-Responsive and Sensory Seeking (URSS)]]
	4 [[Movement and Low Energy-Weakness (M-LEW)]]
	5 [[Generalized Sensory Differences (GSD)]]
