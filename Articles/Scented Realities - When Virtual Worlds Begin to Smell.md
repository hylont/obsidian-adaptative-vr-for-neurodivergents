- **Timing and latency:** Odors take a moment to reach the nose and can linger. Devices like Nebula mitigate this with small extraction fans. Scent releases should align with meaningful user actions: grasping, turning, opening and give time for a natural sniff.
    
- **Lingering and cross-contamination:** Scents can mix and muddy perception. Short purge cycles and limited simultaneous odors maintain clarity.
    
- **Individual variability:** Sensitivity and preference differ widely; quick calibration tests help tailor intensity.
    
- **Adaptation:** Continuous exposure leads to olfactory fatigue. Short, pulsed releases keep scents perceptible and reduce [[Desensitization]]. ([[Sensory fatigue]])
